# Documentation App

The App is ment for any company that would like to have a documentation-app.
Think for example of work instructions, manuals, information for clients and so on.
The app provides books, calculation, decision trees and in the future more.

The app is build in React Native Javascript, with help of Expo we can make it universal for Android and IOS. 
It makes use of a local database (SQLite) and is connected to the application server api.

## Local development

Make sure you are using node 12, we recommend you to use node version manager (nvm).
Make sure 'expo cli' is installed.

First decide what customer and thereby what related assets you would like to use, 
run the following command in the root of the project and follow the instructions in the terminal output:

    bash ./customer-assets/setAssets.sh

Then start the project, in the project directory, you can run:

    # local development:
    npx env-cmd -f .env.development expo start -c

    # customer specific:
    npx env-cmd -f .env.academie-voor-ambulancezorg expo start -c
    
    # default:
    npx env-cmd -f .env expo start -c

It starts a webpage with instructions how to develop the app in the development mode.

    # Production and staging for customer:
